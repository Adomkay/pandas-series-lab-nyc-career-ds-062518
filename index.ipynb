    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll get hands-on practice with all the cool things the `Series` class in `pandas` has to offer!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a basic `Series` object and set the index. \n",
    "1. Use pandas to read in data and store in a `Series`  object.\n",
    "1. Gain familiarity with the basic functionality of series objects and the methods it contains.\n",
    "1. Create basic plots out of data stored in a pandas series.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",

If you find yourself stuck during this lab, or you're just curious to the pandas `Series` class, take a look at the [pandas series docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html)!\n",

    "We'll begin by exploring a couple different ways of creating pandas `Series` objects.  \n",

    "\n",
    "One way that pandas objects differ from vanilla python collections is the ability to handle multiple data types.  Recall that python lists are dynamically typed--we can create lists that hold multiple objects with different data types.  In pure python, something like:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So what happens when we pass in data to a Pandas series that contains multiple data types? Try it in the cell below and see what happens. Create a new pandas Series called customer_info_series, and pass in the python list in called `customer_info` in the list above. Then, access `customer_info_series` to see the values it contains, as well as the **_dtype_** (short for _data type_) everything is stored as."
