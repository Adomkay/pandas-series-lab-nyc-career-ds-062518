    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll get hands-on practice with the all the cool things the `Series` class in `pandas` has to offer!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a basic `Series` object and set the index. \n",
    "1. Use pandas to read in data and store in a `Series`  object.\n",
    "1. Gain familiarity with the basic functionality of series objects and the methods it contains.\n",
    "1. Create basic plots out of data stored in a pandas series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As with anytime you find yourself working with an industry-standard library or framework, it's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with the documentation.  If you find yourself stuck during this lab, or you're just curious to the pandas `Series` class, take a look at the [pandas series docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html)!\n",

    "\n",
    "In pandas, everything is powered by **_numpy_**, so things work a little differently.  Pandas `Series` objects are backed by numpy arrays, which are **_statically typed_**, meaning that all data contained in the numpy array must be of the same data type.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens when we pass in data to a Pandas series that contains multiple data types? Try it in the cell below and see what happens. Create a new pandas Series called customer_info_series, and pass in the python list in called `customer_info` in the list above. Then, access `customer_info_series` to see the values it contains, as well as the **_dtype_** (short for _data type_) everything is stored as."

    "In this lab, we learned about to use the pandas `Series` object.  We learned how to create and store data inside of `Series` objects, and that data stored within a series is statically typed (must all be of the same data type), or else it will all be cast to strings.  We also learned about how to access data through the index, how to slice individual data points as well as ranges of data, and how to set the index values ourselves to make the data easier to read and understand.  Finally, we got some practice working with real-world time series data, answered questions about it using built-in methods for descriptive statistics, and even visualized our data with a nice time series plot.
